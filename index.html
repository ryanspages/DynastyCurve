<h1>Dynasty Curve: MLB Projections</h1>
<h2>Population Age Curve</h2>
<canvas id="populationChart" width="800" height="300"></canvas>
<p>This age curve is built from hitters between 2005 and 2025 with at least 300 plate appearances in a season. For each age, median wRC+ is calculated and smoothed to reduce noise, then the peak age is identified. After the peak, a survivorship adjustment is applied so older ages aren’t inflated by only elite players remaining in the league. The curve is smoothed again and normalized so peak performance equals 1.</p>
