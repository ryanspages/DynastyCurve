<h1>Dynaty Curve: MLB Projections</h1>
<h2>Population Age Curve</h2>
<canvas id="populationChart" width="800" height="300"></canvas>
<p>This age curve is built from hitters between 2005 and 2025 with at least 300 plate appearances in a season. For each age, median wRC+ is calculated and smoothed to reduce noise, then the peak age is identified. After the peak, a survivorship adjustment is applied so older ages aren’t inflated by only elite players remaining in the league. The curve is smoothed again and normalized so peak performance equals 1.</p>

<h2>Player History + Forecast</h2>
<input list="playerList" id="playerSearch" placeholder="Select a player">
<datalist id="playerList"></datalist>
<canvas id="playerChart" width="800" height="300"></canvas>
<p>For player forecasts, the age curve defines the expected performance at each age. A player’s recent seasons are compared to this curve to estimate a skill multiplier, weighted toward more recent and higher-PA seasons. That skill level is then applied to future ages on the curve, producing forecasted wRC+ values relative to league average.</p>
